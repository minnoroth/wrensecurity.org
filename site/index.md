        Automations/Workflows
      </template>
      <template #description-2>
        Define your workflow and approval processes, and empower managers to make decisions in access provisioning while leaving the rest to automation. This way, you can ensure that the responsibility is placed in the right hands, instead of burdening your administrators.
